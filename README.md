LDSO 2020-2021

This project was made during the LDSO course of FEUP.

SmartXchange is a tool that provides a virtual stock exchange system, supporting the growth of new
and better business ideas. By simulating reality in this virtual competition, players are prone to a risk-taking attitude which will lead to business model refinements, according with the movement of the virtual market. In the end, entrepreneurs will have stronger business models and greater confidence in their business ideas.
